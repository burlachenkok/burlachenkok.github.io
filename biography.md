Konstantin Burlachenko is a fifth-year Computer Science Ph.D. candidate and a member of [Peter Richtárik's](https://richtarik.org/) Optimization and Machine Learning Lab, part of the [KAUST AI Initiative](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ai), led by [Jürgen Schmidhuber](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/).

He earned his M.S. degree in Computer Science and Control Systems from [Bauman Moscow State University](http://bmstu.ru/) in 2009. After graduation, he worked as a Senior Engineer for [Acronis](https://www.acronis.com/), [Yandex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandex), [NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/), and later as a Principal Engineer for [HUAWEI](https://huawei.ru/). Between 2015 and 2019, Konstantin participated in the [Non-Degree Option Program](https://online.stanford.edu/non-degree-option-program) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), earning two graduate certificates:

* [Data, Models and Optimization Graduate Certificate](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/data-models-and-optimization-graduate-certificate)
* [Artificial Intelligence Graduate Certificate](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-graduate-certificate)

## Research Focus

Konstantin's current research centers on Distributed Stochastic Optimization and [Federated Learning](https://research.google/pubs/pub45648/).
It turns out that his algorithmic tools and methodologies have broader applicability beyond Federated Learning, covering areas such as:

* Large Language Models (see [Link-1](https://burlachenkok.github.io/pv-tuning-neurips/))
* Distributed Systems (see [Link-2](https://burlachenkok.github.io/ufednl-in-arxiv/))
* Cryptography (see [Link-3](https://burlachenkok.github.io/FL-Privacy-From-Compressor-Accepted-on-DML2023/))


In each project, Konstantin aims for either significant practical improvements over existing solutions or to bring new perspectives on optimal algorithms.


## Conferences

Konstantin’s work has been presented and accepted at prestigious venues, including:

- Neural Information Processing Systems ([NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/))
- International Conference on Machine Learning ([ICML](https://icml.cc/))
- International Conference on Learning Representations ([ICLR](https://iclr.cc/))
