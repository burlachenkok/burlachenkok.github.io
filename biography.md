Konstantin Burlachenko is a systems-oriented researcher specializing in scalable, high-performance scientific software. His work bridges theoretical algorithm design with practical, compute-efficient implementations. He aims for substantial practical improvements over the status quo and new perspectives on theoretically optimal algorithms.

## Education and Experience

Konstantin received his M.S. in Computer Science and Control Systems from [Bauman Moscow State Technical University](http://bmstu.ru/) 2009. Following graduation, he worked as a Senior Engineer at [Acronis](https://www.acronis.com/), [Yandex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandex), and [NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/), later becoming a Principal Engineer at [Huawei](https://huawei.ru/).

From 2015 to 2019, he completed the [Non-Degree Option Program](https://online.stanford.edu/non-degree-option-program) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), earning two graduate certificates:
* [Data, Models, and Optimization](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/data-models-and-optimization-graduate-certificate)
* [Artificial Intelligence](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-graduate-certificate)

In 2020, Konstantin returned to academia to deepen his scientific expertise, conduct rigorous research, and pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/).

* **2020**: Member of [Peter Richtárik's](https://richtarik.org/) Optimization and Machine Learning Lab, part of the [KAUST AI Initiative](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ai) led by [Jürgen Schmidhuber](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/).
* **2021**: Offered an AI and Systems Co-Design internship at [Meta, USA](https://www.meta.com).
* **2024**: Interned with the Private Federated Learning ML team at [Apple, UK](https://www.apple.com/).
* **2025**: Defended his Ph.D. dissertation, *"Optimization Methods and Software for Federated Learning,"* before a committee of global leaders in optimization, systems, HPC, control, and AI: [Peter Richtárik](https://richtarik.org/), [Stephen Boyd](https://stanford.edu/~boyd/), [Nic Lane](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/ndl32), [David Keyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_E._Keyes), [Eric Feron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Feron), and [Suhaib Fahmy](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/profiles/suhaib-fahmy).

## Conferences

His research has been presented at leading venues, including:

- Neural Information Processing Systems ([NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/))
- International Conference on Machine Learning ([ICML](https://icml.cc/))
- International Conference on Learning Representations ([ICLR](https://iclr.cc/))
