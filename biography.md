Konstantin Burlachenko is a systems-oriented machine learning researcher specializing in scalable optimization and high-performance scientific software. His works bridges theoretical algorithm design with practical, compute-efficient implementations for federated and distributed learning.

Konstantin earned his M.S. degree in Computer Science and Control Systems from [Bauman Moscow State University](http://bmstu.ru/) in 2009. After graduation, he worked as a Senior Engineer for [Acronis](https://www.acronis.com/), [Yandex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandex), and [NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/), later serving as a Principal Engineer at [HUAWEI](https://huawei.ru/).

Between 2015 and 2019, he completed the [Non-Degree Option Program](https://online.stanford.edu/non-degree-option-program) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), earning two graduate certificates:
* [Data, Models and Optimization Graduate Certificate](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/data-models-and-optimization-graduate-certificate)
* [Artificial Intelligence Graduate Certificate](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-graduate-certificate)

In 2020, Konstantin re-entered academia to deepen his scientific expertise, explore research in rigorous detail, and pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science.

* **2020–2025**: Member of [Peter Richtárik's](https://richtarik.org/) Optimization and Machine Learning Lab, part of the [KAUST AI Initiative](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ai), led by [Jürgen Schmidhuber](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/).
* **2021**: Offered for a Internship in AI and Systems Co-Design at [META, USA](https://www.meta.com).
* **2024**: Interned with the Private Federated Learning ML Team at [Apple, UK](https://www.apple.com/).
* **2025**: Defended Ph.D. dissertation *"Optimization Methods and Software for Federated Learning,"* before a distinguished committee of global leaders in optimization, systems, HPC, control, and AI: [Peter Richtárik](https://richtarik.org/), [Stephen Boyd](https://stanford.edu/~boyd/), [Nic Lane](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/ndl32), [David Keyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_E._Keyes), [Eric Feron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Feron), and [Suhaib Fahmy](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/profiles/suhaib-fahmy).
