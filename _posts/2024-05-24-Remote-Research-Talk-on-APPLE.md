Remote presentation of our latest research for APPLE.

I appreciate the recent opportunity to present our latest (publicly n/a for now) paper to researchers and research engineers at [Apple Inc.](https://www.apple.com/) engaged in pioneering Federated Learning (FL) systems in particular (see [[pfl: Python framework for Private Federated Learning simulations]](https://github.com/apple/pfl-research)),
and conducting [[Federated Machine Learning Research]](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research?page=1&q=federated+learning) in general.
