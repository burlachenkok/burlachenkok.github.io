I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to present the results of our latest (unpublished) research to researchers and research engineers at Apple Inc. engaged in pioneering Federated Learning (FL) systems (see [[pfl: Python framework for Private Federated Learning simulations]](https://github.com/apple/pfl-research)),
and conducting research in Federated Machine Learning (see [[Machine Learning Research at Apple]](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research?page=1&q=federated+learning))
