*Is it possible to gather six world-renowned scientists and pioneers in one room?*

If you're thinking seriously about it, the answer might seem like *no*.

**But on 08 May 2025, it happened...**

That year, Konstantin Burlachenko defended his Ph.D. in Computer Science at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/).

His doctoral research pushed the boundaries of Federated Learning, focusing on scalable optimization algorithms and high-performance software solutions.

His works bridged the gap between deep mathematical rigor and the practical demands of real-world system implementations and emphasized that these elements should not be considered in isolation.

The dissertation, titled [*"Optimization Methods and Software for Federated Learning"*](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/events/by-type/phd-dissertation-defense/2025/05/08/optimization-methods-and-software-federated) was defended before a distinguished committee of global experts. It marked an event at the intersection of theory and practice in distributed machine learning.

The dissertation committee included:

- **[Peter Richtarik](https://richtarik.org/)** - Professor at KAUST, Konstantin's advisor, and one of the pioneers of Federated Learning. His contributions to randomized and distributed optimization methods are foundational and have shaped the future of the field.
- **[Stephen Boyd](https://stanford.edu/~boyd/)** - Professor at Stanford University, a giant in convex optimization, control systems, and applied mathematics. His groundbreaking works continue to influence entire generations of engineers and applied mathematicians.
- **[Nic Lane](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/ndl32)** - Professor at the University of Cambridge, a leading voice in embedded machine learning and resource-efficient AI. His efforts to make Federated Learning practical and deployable pave the way for its real-world applications.
- **[David Keyes](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/about/administration/office-of-the-president/senior-associate-president)** - Director of the Extreme Computing Research Center at KAUST, a pioneer in high-performance computing, parallel algorithms, and numerical analysis, pushing the limits of computational power.
- **[Suhaib Fahmy](https://accl.kaust.edu.sa/)** - Professor at KAUST, a specialist in reconfigurable computing, systems architecture, and hardware-software co-design, helping to build the future of compute-efficient solutions at KAUST.
- **[Eric Feron](https://ats.kaust.edu.sa/)** - Professor at KAUST, an expert in control theory and autonomous aerospace systems, known for transforming our thoughts about intelligent systems and control theory.

In this moment, the brightest minds from different corners of science and the world converged, and Konstantin made his mark on the scientific world.
