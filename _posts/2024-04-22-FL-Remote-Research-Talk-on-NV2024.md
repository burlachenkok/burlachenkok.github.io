Remote presentation of our latest research for NVIDIA.


---

I sincerely appreciate [Holger R. Roth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-r-roth-b939a79/) inviting me to present the results of our latest research to researchers and research engineers at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/).

[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) stands at the forefront of innovation and also is actively engaged in pioneering Federated Learning (FL) systems such as [[NVFlare](https://developer.nvidia.com/flare)] and FL-related research [[NVFlare/research](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/research)], [[NVFlare/publications](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/publications_and_talks.html)].

One of the distinguished scientists, the Director of [KAUST AI Initiative](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ai), said to me in the kitchen, that [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) has smart people, capable of discerning the significance of recent works emitted from [Prof. Peter Richt√°rik's Lab](https://richtarik.org/) right from their inception.
