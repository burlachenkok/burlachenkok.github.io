Recent research paper presentation at NVIDIA remotely.

I sincerely appreciate [Holger R. Roth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-r-roth-b939a79/) inviting me to present to researchers and research engineers at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/).

[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) stands at the forefront of innovation, and also is actively engaged in pioneering Federated Learning (FL) systems such as ([NVFlare](https://developer.nvidia.com/flare)) and FL-related research ([NVFlare/research](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/research)), ([NVFlare/publications](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/publications_and_talks.html)).

p.s. One of the distinguished scientists, the Director of [KAUST AI Initiative](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ai), said to me in the kitchen at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/), that [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) has smart people, capable of discerning the significance of recent works emanating from [Prof. Peter Richtárik's Lab](https://richtarik.org/) right from their inception.
