Remote Research Talk at NVIDIA

---

I want to express my gratitude to [Holger R. Roth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-r-roth-b939a79/) for inviting me to give a talk for researchers and engineers at NVIDIA working on Federated Learning (FL) systems such as [NVFlare](https://developer.nvidia.com/flare) and FL-related research [NVFlare/research](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/research) remotely.

One scientist (director of KAUST AI Initiative) said to me in the kitchen that NVIDIA has smart guys, which can observe the value in [Prof. Peter Richtarik Lab](https://richtarik.org/) at the beginning.
