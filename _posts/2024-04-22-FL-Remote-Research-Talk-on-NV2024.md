I extend my sincere appreciation to [Holger R. Roth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-r-roth-b939a79/) for inviting me to deliver a presentation to researchers and research engineers at NVIDIA, 
who are actively engaged in pioneering Federated Learning (FL) systems such as [NVFlare](https://developer.nvidia.com/flare) and FL-related research [NVFlare/research](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/research) remotely.


p.s. One of the distinguished scientists, the director of KAUST AI Initiative, said to me in the kitchen, that NVIDIA has smart guys, capable of discerning the significance of recent works emanating from [Prof. Peter Richt√°rik's Lab](https://richtarik.org/) right from the moment of their inception.
