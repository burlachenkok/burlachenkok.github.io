# About Conference

The SIAM Conference on Optimization (OP23) will take place between May 31-June 3, 2023. The conference Location: The Sheraton Grand Seattle, Seattle, Washington, U.S.

The SIAM Conference on Optimization will feature the latest research in theory, algorithms, software, and applications for optimization problems. The conference brings together mathematicians, operations researchers, computer scientists, engineers, software developers, and practitioners, thus providing an ideal environment to share new ideas and important problems among specialists and users of optimization in academia, government, and industry.

# About the Talk

For me, it's a great pleaser to be a speaker at the SIAM Conference on  Optimization (OP23). My presentation title: "Fl_PyTorch: Optimization Research Simulator for Federated Learning".

Details for my presentation: [https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=128776](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=128776).

The FL_PyTorch is a very young project developed as a research work, and after that supported on enthusiasm only. If you are interested in Optimization Research Federated Learning it can be a Tool for you to prototype your approaches.

According to [FeLebrities: a user-centric assessment of Federated Learning Frameworks](https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/FeLebrities_a_user-centric_assessment_of_Federated_Learning_frameworks/21263013) our simulator between [TensorFlow Federated from Google](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated) and [FLUTE from Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/flute-a-scalable-federated-learning-simulation-platform/).

The funding for my visit is covered by my advisor and KAUST University. And I would be glad to present the work and carry on discussions about its future.

However to come to the conference - I need to have B1 VISA to the United States of America. I don't have it, my application is under Administrative Processing for 2 months.

# Abstract

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising technique for edge devices to collaboratively learn a shared machine learning model while keeping training data locally on the device, thereby removing the need to store and access the full data in the cloud. However, FL is difficult to implement, test and deploy in practice considering heterogeneity in common edge device settings, making it fundamentally hard for researchers to efficiently prototype and test their optimization algorithms. In this work, our aim is to alleviate this problem by introducing FL_PyTorch : a suite of open-source software written in python that builds on top of one the most popular research Deep Learning (DL) framework PyTorch. We built FL_PyTorch as a research simulator for FL to enable fast development, prototyping and experimenting with new and existing FL optimization algorithms. Our system supports abstractions that provide researchers with a sufficient level of flexibility to experiment with existing and novel approaches to advance the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, FL_PyTorch is a simple to use console system, allows to run several clients simultaneously using local CPUs or GPU(s), and even remote compute devices without the need for any distributed implementation provided by the user. FL_PyTorch also offers a Graphical User Interface. For new methods, researchers only provide the centralized implementation of their algorithm.
