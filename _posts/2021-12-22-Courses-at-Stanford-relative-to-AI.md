This is a post about systematizing catalog of course at Stanford relative to AI/ML/Optimization/STATs/Control.

[Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) provides various courses regarding constructing and tackling different mathematical models that are collectively called AI these days. In that post, I would like to share the catalog of classes relative to AI at Stanford. The note is based on a recommendation of different professors vision from Stanford including Stephen Boyd, Percy Liang, Andrew Ng, Brad Osgood, John Duchi.
