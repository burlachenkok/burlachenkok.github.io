Systematized catalog of courses at Stanford relative to AI, Machine Learning, Optimization, Statistics, Control Theory, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.

---

[Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) provides various courses regarding constructing and tackling different mathematical models that are collectively called AI these days. In that post, I would like to share the catalog of classes relative to AI at Stanford. The note is based on a recommendation of different professors vision from Stanford, including Stephen Boyd, Percy Liang, Andrew Ng, Brad Osgood, and John Duchi.
