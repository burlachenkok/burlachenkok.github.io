The symposium will be held in [KAUST](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/) with (limited) in-person attendance. The current planned place at 08-MARCH-2022 is Auditorium 0215, between Building 4 and 5. The agenda is available on the event's website: [https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ai/aii-symp-2022](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ai/aii-symp-2022).


*The "Rising Stars in AI Symposium" is geared towards young researchers (including Ph.D. students, PostDocs, and young faculty) who have recently published promising work at leading AI venues. There will be dozens of brief in-person presentations about papers recently accepted at major AI conferences such as NeurIPS, CVPR, EMNLP, ACL, ICML, ICLR, etc.*
