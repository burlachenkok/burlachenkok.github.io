Second Place in the KAUST Chess Tournament.

---


On October 7, 2022, I attended the first chess tournament organized by [Rook and Roll Chess Club](https://campusconnect.kaust.edu.sa/rooknroll/home/) at [KAUST University](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/). I was glad to participate in this event. 

I have obtained the second place in this tournament.
