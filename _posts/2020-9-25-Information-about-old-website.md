I used another homepage from 2011 to 2020. The link to it is: [https://sites.google.com/site/burlachenkok/](https://sites.google.com/site/burlachenkok/).

My old webpage contains 151 random notes on various subjects during my career as a Computer Science Software Engineer/Senior Engineer/Team Leader/Principal Engineer. I always had a mentality for learning and teaching and trying and being critical of myself irrespectively of my job title.

Below are some topics in which subject I have created public personal notes:

## The notes are based on reading classical math books and classical papers in Computer Vision

* Notes about the book of A.N.Kolomogorov, S.V.Fomin - Introductionary Real Analysis.
* Notes about the book of Amir Beck, First-Order Methods in optimization, 2017. That notes has been shared with prof. Amir Beck.
* Notes about EE263, EE364A, and EE364B courses at Leland Stanford Jr. University from prof. Stephen P. Boyd. That notes has been shared with prof. Stephen P. Boyd.
* Overview of some papers in Deep Learning for Image tasks.


## Miscellaneous

* Information about my course projects at Leland Stanford Jr. University when I was a remote student at that University for four years.
* Physics questions important for physics-based simulation and Robotics.
* My reflections on various problems of Machine Learning.
* My reflections on how AI and Machine Learning should be systematized.


## Different notes and posts covered different aspects of engineering

* Usage of programming languages Python, Matlab, C++, Perl, R, JAVA, and software development frameworks as Qt.
* Using specialized software development frameworks: Google TensorFlow, PyTorch.
* GPU programming (CUDA, OpenCL, OpenGL).
* Developing at a user-space level for Linux/Posix OS and Windows Family OS.

## Compressed notes about various mathematical tools

* Convex Optimization and Numerical Optimization.
* Deep understanding of various concepts from Statistics and Machine Learning: KL-divergence, Gini index, Math behind backpropagation.
* Notes about various mathematical tools, including Fourier Transform and Fourier Series.
* Classical things from Linear Dynamical Systems.
* Systematizing catalog of methods used on Control Theory in Applications.

## Compressed information about several aspects of applying AI for practical tasks

* Understanding Deep Learning from scratch.
* Describing popular tricks for Deep Learning.
* Understanding Decision Trees from scratch.
* Considering all stages of applying Machine Learning in the industry.
* Different ways try to systematize AI and ML approaches their possibilities.
* Complete derivations and problem formulations of SVM, Logistics Regression.
* Jargon applied in Classification problems and in Machine Learning.
* Usage aspects of Z3 solver from Microsoft Research.
