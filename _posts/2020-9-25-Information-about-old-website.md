I used my old homepage from 2011 to 2020 [https://sites.google.com/site/burlachenkok/](https://sites.google.com/site/burlachenkok/).

My old webpage contains 151 random notes on various subjects during my career as Computer Science guy with Applied Science mentality.

Below are some topics in which subject I have created personal notes:

## The notes based on reading classical math books and classical papers in Computer Vision

* Notes about the book of A.N.Kolomogorov, S.V.Fomin - Introductionary Real Analysis
* Notes about the book of Amir Beck, First-Order Methods in optimization, 2017
* Overview of some papers in Deep Learning for Image tasks

## Different notes and posts covered different aspects of engineering

* Usage of programming languages Python, Matlab, C++, Perl, R, JAVA
* Usage of big Software development frameworks like Qt
* Using specialized software development frameworks like Google TensorFlow
* Notes about GPU programming and another (via covering CUDA, OpenCL, and OpenGL programming aspects)
* Notes about using and developing at user-space level for Linux OS and Windows OS

## Compressed notes about various mathematical tools

* Some aspects of Convex Optimization and Numerical Optimization
* Deep understanding of various concepts from Statistics and Machine Learning: KL-divergence, Gini index, Math behind backpropagation
* Notes about various mathematical tools, including Fourier Transform and Fourier Series
* Classical things from Linear Algebra SVD, ODEs.
* Systematizing catalog of methods used on Control Theory in Applications

## Compressed information about several aspects of applying AI for practical tasks

* Understanding Deep Learning from scratch
* Considering several tricks for Deep Learning
* Using popular libraries for Deep Learning
