I am glad to share that Simone Scardapane has acknowledged my help in improving his manuscript, Alice’s Adventures in a Differentiable Wonderland — Volume I, A Tour of the Land (arXiv: 2404.17625). 

The book builds from first principles, using clarity, intuition, and rigor to guide the reader. 
Throughout my PhD, I deeply valued both transparent, and detail-oriented style: both in the engineering aspects and in the scientific framing (in my view, artificial boundaries can be questioned). 

Simone Scardapane is an Associate Professor at Sapienza University of Rome, with a strong research focus on efficient and explainable neural network models, geometric deep learning, and continual learning. 

In my view, this book stands confidently alongside the great classics of machine learning as Bishop’s Pattern Recognition & Machine Learning.

If you’re interested in a thoughtful, principled tour of modern architectures (convolutions, transformers, graph networks, recurrent models), I highly recommend checking out the full draft on arXiv: 2404.17625.
