The paper *"Sharper Rates and Flexible Framework for Nonconvex SGD with Client and Data Sampling"* was accepted by the [Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/tmlr/index.html). TMLR is a venue for dissemination of machine learning research which emphasizes technical correctness over subjective significance.

Our paper improves the optimal first-order non-convex optimization method [PAGE](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/li21a.html) in three ways.

I was glad to work with my peers from the [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/) and hope for further cooperation with them:
* [Alexander Tyurin](https://k3nfalt.github.io/)
* [Lukang Sun](https://lukangsun.github.io/)
* Prof. [Peter Richtarik](https://richtarik.org/)
