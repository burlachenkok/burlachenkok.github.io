title: Second Semester at KAUST as CEMSE/CS Ph.D.
published: true
---

This is a post about my second semester (Spring, 2021) at KAUST.

At KAUST, classes are not big, and professors are world-level scientists.

This allows having direct dialogue with professors on the subject to obtain deep insights and obtain inspiration for the paper.

# Classes that I took (CS332, CS323, CS398):

As a subpart of my academic load, I took classes at KAUST during my second semester, which I can use for Ph.D. qualification requirements, and from another side, that are important for my academic work.

In this post, I would like to give some small insides about all of them.

## Federated Learning, CS 332

The course was taught by a professor in the CEMSE division [prof. Peter Richtarik](https://richtarik.org/) and the course are almost paper-based.

During the class, students jointly with the professor prepared high-quality lecture notes in various subjects including information theory, local optimization methods, second-order optimization methods, software and systems for FL,
cryptography, internet of things, background materials to go deep into strong mathematical proves of various statements.

Another part of the class was targeted to create publishable work, which in my case happens. The class provides a hot start for the work.

If you're a student and want to go deep into the true multidisciplinary direction of AI, this FL can be a choice. Especially the FL fields due to its working regime (across billions of devices in cross-device setting) requires understanding what we are doing. 
Heuristics method in that field can be used as a temporary solution, but in the long term, everything should have a strict mathematical form.

The course allows enough freedom to make a selection in various topics. The course has opened my eyes that preparing good lecture notes in difficult subjects in compact form is challenging.

## Deep Learning for Visual Computing, CS323

Even though I faced Deep Learning methods during my career at NVIDIA and during my academic passing of several classes at Stanford University, this class was very useful for me.

The course was taught by [prof. Bernard Ghannem](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/bernard-ghanem) from [Image and Video Understanding Lab](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ivul).
At the moment of 2021, prof. Bernard Ghanem is also KAUST AI Initiative Leader and Deputy Director of AI Initiative at KAUST. This was a very pretty intensive course in terms of amount materials and homework assignments.

prof. Bernard Ghanem is similar to my advisor, prof. Peter Richtarik encourages questions and discussion during a lecture. Prof. Bernard has an optimization and signal processing background. He accurately
highlights and helps filter what is interesting results and temporal heuristics that the community can not solve exactly. I think this course is very useful for people who want to catch possible improvements in state-of-the-art methods in image and video deep learning methods.

The course is a mixture of classical computer vision methods with covering works from AlexNet up to recent models, including Transformers and PointNet for point cloud.

The very unusual thing compared to the education model at Stanford where I took classes CS229, CS230 with prof. A.Ng is in the following. 

Students have to read original papers and have to answer in detail for all materials. The course has opened my eyes that in Applied Machine Learning, it's far easier in 90% of cases to read original papers.
Of course, it's not always a case if consider all Applied Math in general, but in that case, it is.

Another special thank if to a group of amazing teaching assistants. The homework started from the first principles with using PyTorch as computation backend and simple models. Finally, somewhere in the middle, the course starts to consider pretty complicated schemas for image, video, point cloud classification.

I definitely recommend this course, especially. 
                
## CS398 Graduate Seminar

Graduate Seminars is a non-credit weekly seminar in various fields connected to the CEMSE division where speakers are professors from KAUST or another university, which share their research.
