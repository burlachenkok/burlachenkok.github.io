title: Second Semester at KAUST as CEMSE/CS Ph.D.
published: false

This is a post about my second semester (Sprint, 2021) at KAUST.

At KAUST classes are not big and professors are world-level scientists.

This gives the opportunity to have direct dialogue with professors on the subject to obtain deep insights and obtain inspiration for the paper.

# Classes that I took (CS332, CS323, CS398):

As a subpart of my academic load, I took classes at KAUST during my second semester which I can use for Ph.D. qualification requirements, and from another side that are important for my academic work.


In this post, I would like to give some small insides about all of them.

## Federated Learning, CS 332

The course was taught by [prof. Peter Richtarik](https://richtarik.org/) and the course are almost paper based.

During the class students jointly with professor prepared high quality lecture notes in various subject including: information theory, local optimizaiton methods, second order optimization methods, software and systems for FL,
cryptography, need background materials to go deep into strong mathematical proves of various statements.

Another part of the class was targeted to create publishable work, which in my case happens. If you're a student, and you want go deep into true multisciplinary direction of AI this can be a choice.

Especially the FL fields due to it's working regime (across billions of devices in cross-device setting) requires understnading what we are doing. Heuristics method in that field can be used as temporaly solution, but in long term everything should have a strict mathematical form.

## Deep Learning for Visual Computing, CS323

Even I faced with Deep Learning methods during my career at NVIDIA and during my academic passing of several class at Stanford University this class was very usefull for me.

The course was taught by [prof. Bernard Ghannem](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/bernard-ghanem) from [Image and Video Understanding Lab](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ivul).
At moment of 2021 prof. Bernard Ghanem is also KAUST AI Initiative Leader and Deputy Director of AI Initiative at KAUST. This was very pretty intensive course in terms of amount materials and homework assignments.

prof. Bernard Ghanem similar as my advisor prof. Peter Richtarik encourage questions and discussion during a lecture. Prof. Bernard has optimizatioon and signal processing background and he very accurately
highlight and help to filter what are interesting results and what are temporal heuristics that community can not solve exactly. I think this course is very usefull for people who love math and for people who
wants deep into mathematical modeling of Deep Learning. 

The course is a mixture of classical computer vision methods with covering works from AlexNet up to recent models including Transformers.

The very unusual thing compare to education model at Stanford where I took classes CS229, CS230 with prof. A.Ng is in the following. 
Students have to read original papers and have to answer in details for all materials. The course has opened my eyes that in Applied Machine Learning it's far more easy in 90% of cases to read original papers.
Of course, it's not always a case, but very often it is. 

Another special thanks if for a group of amazing teaching assistants: Modar Alfadly,...
The homeworks started from first principles and simple models and finally somewhere in the middle the course start to consider pretty complicated schemas for image,video,point cloud classification.

I defintely recomend this course.
                
## CS398 Graduate Seminar

Graduate Seminars is a non-credit weekly seminar in various fields which has a connection to the CEMSE division where speakers are professors from KAUST or another university, 
which share their research or observations.
