Technical Note. Exploring the Python 3 Language from a Computing Perspective.

---

During the Eid Al Fitr holidays, I created the following document [Technical Note.] [Exploring Python3 Language from a Computing Perspective](https://github.com/burlachenkok/exploring-python3/blob/main/python3-note.md) available on GitHub: 
[https://github.com/burlachenkok/exploring-python3/blob/main/python3-note.md](https://github.com/burlachenkok/exploring-python3/blob/main/python3-note.md).

There are several reasons for using the Python language (https://www.python.org/).

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/) is often the language of choice for prototyping in academic courses. So, if your lifestyle involves continuous education, you will encounter Python.

2. During interviews for R&D positions, Python can also be used as a language for writing algorithms.

3. Python, in the realm of scripting languages, is arguably one of the best choices available. Development in [Python](https://www.python.org/) is significantly more productive than in other scripting languages, such as [Perl](https://www.perl.org/).

4. There is an extensive collection of libraries available, as well as free and commercial integrated development environments (IDEs) such as PyCharm and Visual Studio Code. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are two popular examples.

The presented note contains a concise language tutorial, and contains a description of several profiling tools for Software Development. In case you have never worked on highly critical Software Development that needs to function optimally within an operating system, you may not be familiar with them at all. I hope this description will help fill any gaps you may have and assist you in eliminating them.
