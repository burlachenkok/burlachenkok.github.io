Technical Note. Exploring the Python3 Language from a Computing Perspective.

---

During the Eid Al Fitr holidays, I have created the following document.

[Technical Note. Exploring Python3 Language from a Computing Perspective] (https://github.com/burlachenkok/exploring-python3/blob/main/python3-note.md) available on GitHub.

[https://github.com/burlachenkok/exploring-python3/blob/main/python3-note.md](https://github.com/burlachenkok/exploring-python3/blob/main/python3-note.md).

There are several reasons for using [Python Language](https://www.python.org/) which originally was created by Guido Van Rossum. 

Development in [Python](https://www.python.org/) is significantly more productive than in scripting languages such as Perl. Next, Python is often the language of choice for prototyping in academic courses.
So, if your lifestyle involves continuous education, you will encounter Python. During interviews for R&D positions, Python can also be used as a language for writing algorithms.
Python, in the realm of scripting languages, is arguably one of the best choices available. 
This is primarily due to its extensive collection of libraries and the availability of both free and commercial integrated development environments (IDEs) such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

I have to switch between several languages. In my opinion Having a Short Tutorial is valuable. 

Secondary, the note contains a description of some profiling tools for Software Development. 
In case you have never worked on highly critical software development which should work in the best possible way in Operation System, you may not be familiar with them at all.
