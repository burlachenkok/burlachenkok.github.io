Technical Note. Exploring the Python 3 Language from a Computing Perspective.

---

During the Eid Al Fitr holidays, I created the document:

**Technical Note. Exploring Python3 Language from a Computing Perspective** 

It is essentially a cocktail between Python Language Tutorial and some popular Profiling Tools for applications working in the user space:

[https://github.com/burlachenkok/exploring-python3](https://github.com/burlachenkok/exploring-python3).

The presented note contains a concise language tutorial and a description of several libraries.

Also, it contains a description of several profiling tools for Software Development for Linux/Posix OS and Windows OS Family. In case you have never worked on highly critical Software Development that needs to function optimally within an operating system, you may not be familiar with them at all. I hope this description will help fill any gaps you may have and assist you in eliminating them.
The total number of pages in the compiled PDF is **62**. It contains big margins and a lot of space if taken by code snippets, so please be not afraid of this number.

There are several reasons for using the [Python](https://www.python.org/) language in addition to the fact this is popular according to [TIOBE-Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/):

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/) is often the language of choice for prototyping in academic courses. So, if your lifestyle involves continuous education, you will encounter Python.

2. During interviews for R&D positions, Python can also be used as a language for writing algorithms.

3. Python, in the realm of scripting languages, is arguably one of the best choices available. Development in [Python](https://www.python.org/) is significantly more productive than in other scripting languages, such as [Perl](https://www.perl.org/).

4. There is an extensive collection of libraries available, as well as free and commercial integrated development environments (IDEs) such as PyCharm and Visual Studio Code. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are two popular examples.
