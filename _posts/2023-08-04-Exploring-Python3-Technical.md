Technical Note. Exploring the Python3 Language from a Computing Perspective.

---

During the Eid Al Fitr holidays, I have created the following document.

[Technical Note. [Exploring Python3 Language from a Computing Perspective] (https://github.com/burlachenkok/exploring-python3/blob/main/python3-note.md) available on GitHub.

[https://github.com/burlachenkok/exploring-python3/blob/main/python3-note.md](https://github.com/burlachenkok/exploring-python3/blob/main/python3-note.md).

There are several reasons for using Python. Development in Python is significantly more productive than in scripting languages such as Perl.
Next, Python is often the language of choice for prototyping in academic courses.
So, if your lifestyle involves continuous education, you will encounter Python. 
During interviews for R&D positions, Python can also be used as a language for writing algorithms.

Python, in the realm of scripting languages, is arguably one of the best choices available. 
This is primarily due to its extensive collection of libraries and the availability of both free and commercial integrated development environments (IDEs) such as PyCharm and Visual Studio Code.

However, there is one friction zone...At least in the past, this crucial software development was done exclusively in C++ or in C. And it's not just C++ or C itself, but rather a C++ style with a system flavor.

But Python started to be used for real software development. Complex languages and Complex hardware sometimes have an extremely steep learning curve and even usage of them create a problem from the start.

I have to switch between several languages. In my opinion, having a Short Tutorial is valuable. The note contains a description of some profiling tools.
In case you have never worked on highly critical software development which should work in the best possible way in Operation System, you may not be familiar with them at all.
