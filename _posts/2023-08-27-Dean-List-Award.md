Receiving the Dean's List Award 2023.

---

It's my great pleasure for me to receive a Dean's List Award for my performance in 2022-2023.
This is awarded annually to the Top 20% of PhD and MS/PhD students in the [CEMSE](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa) division at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology](https://kaust.edu.sa/en/) and comes with a one-time cash award.
