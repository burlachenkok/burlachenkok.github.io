title: Courses at Stanford not relative to AI (at first glance)
published: true

This is a post about the catalog of courses at Stanford relative to creating various systems with leveraging science and engineering from various fields.

---

[Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) provides various courses regarding constructing and tackling different mathematical models for constructing engineering systems. Some of them with personal bias are listed below. They do not have AI prefix or suffix in it.

Nevertheless, it's upgradable to basic Machine Learning with one (not easy) step: You localize heuristic and replace it with ML data-driven approach. You can for sure do this if the methodology is not rigorous. But in fact, sometimes, people do it even if the methodology is rigorous, but computation is enormous.

***p.s.***
There is a vision of prof. [John C. Duchi](https://web.stanford.edu/~jduchi/) that he has shared in [Simons Institute](https://simons.berkeley.edu/) during [Statistical Theory, Privacy and Data Analysis, APR-2019](https://youtu.be/GJXiYzi8KRc?t=591) at 09:51 that there are a lot of disciplines that underpins AI.
And there are people in academia (John C. Duchi is exmaple of that) that can not state "AI is everything and AI solves everything".

In any case, I hope the catalog below will be useful for people who do science and engineering. For example [EE261](https://see.stanford.edu/course/ee261) is an essential core for understanding and creating devices and approaches in:

* Digital Signal Processing
* Digital Filters
* Compressed Sensing
* Music Composition. Catalog of courses relative to Music at Stanford [https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses)
* Medical Images
