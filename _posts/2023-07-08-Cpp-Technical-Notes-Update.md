I am glad that technical note [Technical Note. From C++1998 to C++2020.](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md#references) which covers the C and all primary C++ programming language standards (C++03/98/11/14/17/20):

* Has been adopted to the Educational website of AMD Inc.
* Has 107 stars on the GitHub

As of *July 08, 2023,*, this technical note in PDF format consists of 102 pages. 

Recent updates to the document include the following:

* Update of information to generate and suppress the generation of Special Class Members.
* Updates regarding function inlining.
* More well-developed information regarding move semantics.
* More detailed information about aliasing.
* References to compiler optimization flags.
* Appendix about "Virtual Inheritance Inside", "Object Orientated Design", "Object Orientated Design Patterns
* Big Appendix about general-purpose CPU Compute Optimization technics, which is essentially based on a course from Prof. Charles Leiserson, and Prof. Julian Shun (6.172, MIT, 2018). Performance Optimization (for CPU) is a nearby concept accessible from the C++ language level and is sometimes the reason behind using C++ in the first place.
