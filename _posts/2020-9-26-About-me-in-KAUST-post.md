I hold a master’s degree in computer science from Bauman Moscow State Technical University (BMSTU), Russia. 
After graduating from BMSTU, I worked in several prominent Moscow companies, such as Huawei, NVIDIA, and Yandex. 
                                                                                                                  
After spending time in industry I have backed into academia.
I have joined KAUST in August 2020 as a Ph.D. candidate and member of Professor Peter Richtarik's Optimization and Machine Learning Lab.
