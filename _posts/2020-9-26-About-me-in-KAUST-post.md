I hold a Master's Degree in Computer Science from Bauman Moscow State Technical University (BMSTU), Russia. 

After graduating from BMSTU, I worked in several prominent companies, such as Huawei, NVIDIA, and Yandex. 
                                                                                                                  
After spending time in industry I have backed into academia. I have joined KAUST in August 2020 as a Ph.D. candidate and member of Professor [Peter Richtarik's Optimization and Machine Learning Lab](https://richtarik.org/).
