Technical Note. From C++1998 to C++2020.

---

I am glad to share a seventy one page Technical Note in which I have shared complete information regarding the C programming language and all primary C++ programming language standards.

* GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020)
* Link to PDF: [Cpp-Technical-Note.pdf](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.pdf)
* Link to Markdown: [Cpp-Technical-Note.md](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md)

The C++ programming language is complex, but currently, it's the fastest (in terms of execution speed in CPU) high-level general - purpose programming language in the world. The information in that technical note can be helpful for three categories of people:

* People who want to refresh or go deep into several language constructions of C++.
* Obtain a pretty in-depth overview of new features from C++11/14/17/20.
* People who need to support (legacy) C++03 or C99 code base.

Right now and in future authors of that technical note are welcome anybody who wants to make this note cleaner.  The style which I think is correct is the style between language lawyer and practical applicability, but we don't want to have any of the extremes of both style types.
