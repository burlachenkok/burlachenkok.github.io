published: true

This technical note is devoted to covering information regarding all primary C++ programming language standards: C++03/98/11/14/17/20.

I am glad to share a technical note with some details regarding the C and all primary C++ programming language standards based on my experience and materials from the [Reference Section](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md#references) of this document.

As of *August 15, 2022*, this technical note in PDF format consists of 72 pages. 

* GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020)
* Link to Markdown: [Cpp-Technical-Note.md](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md)

The C++ programming language is complex, but currently, it's the fastest high-level general purpose programming language in the world.

The limitations of traditional interpreter scripting languages (as of 2022) are described in this technical note as well (See the appropriate section: [Link](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md#downsides-of-interpretable-languages)).

The information from this technical note can be helpful mainly for three categories of people:

* People who want to refresh or go deep into several language constructions in C++.
* Obtain a pretty in-depth overview of new features from C++11/14/17/20.
* People who need to support (legacy) C++03 or C99 code base.

Right now and in the future authors of this technical note will welcome anybody who wants to contribute for improvement. There is only one requirement for contributions to it - it's about style. The style should be between language lawyer and practical applicability, not extremes of both of them.
