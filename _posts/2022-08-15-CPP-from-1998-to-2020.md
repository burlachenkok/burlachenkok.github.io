Technical Note dedicated to covering information regarding the C programming language and all primary C++ programming language standards: C++03/98/11/14/17/20.

I am glad to share a technical Note in which I have shared complete information regarding the C programming language and all primary C++ programming language standards.

At the moment of *August 15, 2022* that technical note in PDF format consist of 71 pages. 


* GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020)
* Link to PDF: [Cpp-Technical-Note.pdf](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.pdf)
* Link to Markdown: [Cpp-Technical-Note.md](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md)

The C++ programming language is complex, but currently, it's the fastest (in terms of execution speed in CPU) high-level general-purpose programming language in the world that is almost always used in production and special cases is used on prototyping. 

The limitations of traditional interpreter scripting languages (at the moment of 2022) like Python are described in that technical note as well (Section devoted fot that question: [Link](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md#downsides-of-interpretable-languages))

The information in that technical note can be helpful for three categories of people:

* People who want to refresh or go deep into several language constructions of C++.
* Obtain a pretty in-depth overview of new features from C++11/14/17/20.
* People who need to support (legacy) C++03 or C99 code base.

Right now and in the future authors of that technical note will welcome anybody who wants to make this note cleaner. There is only one requirement for contributions to it - it's about style. The style should be between language lawyer and practical applicability, not extremes of both of them.
