The technical note devoted to covering information regarding all primary C++ programming language standards: C++03/98/11/14/17/20.

---

I am glad to share a technical note with some details regarding the C and all primary C++ programming language standards based on my experience and materials from the [Reference Section](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md#references) of that document.

At the moment of *August 15, 2022*, that technical note in PDF format consists of 72 pages. 

* GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020)
* Link to PDF: [Cpp-Technical-Note.pdf](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.pdf)
* Link to Markdown: [Cpp-Technical-Note.md](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md)

The C++ programming language is complex, but currently, it's the fastest high-level general purpose programming language in the world. 

The limitations of traditional interpreter scripting languages (at the moment of 2022) are described in that technical note as well (Section devoted for that: [Link](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md#downsides-of-interpretable-languages)).

The information from that technical note can be helpful mainly for three categories of people:

* People who want to refresh or go deep into several language constructions in C++.
* Obtain a pretty in-depth overview of new features from C++11/14/17/20.
* People who need to support (legacy) C++03 or C99 code base.

Right now and in the future authors of that technical note will welcome anybody who wants to make this note cleaner. There is only one requirement for contributions to it - it's about style. The style should be between language lawyer and practical applicability, not extremes of both of them.
