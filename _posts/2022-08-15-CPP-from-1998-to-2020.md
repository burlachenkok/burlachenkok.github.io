Technical Note dedicated of covering information regarding the C programming language and all primary C++ programming language standards: C++03/98/11/14/17/20.

I am glad to share a technical Note in which I have shared complete information regarding the C programming language and all primary C++ programming language standards.

* GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020)
* Link to PDF: [Cpp-Technical-Note.pdf](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.pdf)
* Link to Markdown: [Cpp-Technical-Note.md](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md)

At moment of 15, August, 2022 physicall that note in PDF format contains 71 page and note is dedicated for programming language only.

The C++ programming language is complex, but currently, it's the fastest (in terms of execution speed in CPU) high-level general - purpose programming language in the world that is almost always used in production and in special cases is ued on prototyping. 

The limitations of traditional interepreter scripting languages (at moment of 2022) like Python described in that technical note as well.

The information in that technical note can be helpful for three categories of people:

* People who want to refresh or go deep into several language constructions of C++.
* Obtain a pretty in-depth overview of new features from C++11/14/17/20.
* People who need to support (legacy) C++03 or C99 code base.

Right now and in future authors of that technical note are welcome anybody who wants to make this note cleaner.  The style which I think is correct is the style between language lawyer and practical applicability, but we don't want to have any of the extremes of both style types.
