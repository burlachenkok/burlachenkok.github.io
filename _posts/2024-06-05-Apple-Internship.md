Internship in Private Federated Learning ML Team Apple Inc.

It was a great honor for me to obtain an offer for an internship with the Private Federated Learning ML Team at [Apple Inc.](https://www.apple.com/)

I am grateful that the visa processing, handled by both the government and visa agencies, was completed in just a few months. It allows this internship to become a reality.

During my internship, I will be:

* Residing at the following temporary address: [27 Woodlark Road CB30HT Cambridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1NWYf4jQsvKp1fcz9)
* Work from Apple Research office with address: [30 Station Rd, Cambridge CB1 2JH, UK](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GGFGBMyPrHGAAp9H8)
