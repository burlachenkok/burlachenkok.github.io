Internship in Private Federated Learning ML Team Apple Inc.

---

I am glad to obtain the internship offer from the Private Federated Learning ML Team at [Apple Inc.](https://www.apple.com/), Cambridge, UK.

It was great that the working visa processing took only a few months rather than several years, allowing this exciting internship to become a reality.
