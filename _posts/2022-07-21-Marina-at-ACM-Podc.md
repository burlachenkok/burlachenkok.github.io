The paper [MARINA: Faster Non-Convex Distributed Learning with Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07845) on [Principles of Distributed Learning of ACM PODC 2022](https://dcl.epfl.ch/site/podc2022).

The [ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing](https://www.podc.org/about/) is an international forum on the theory, design, analysis, implementation, and application of distributed systems and networks. The Symposium aims to improve understanding of the principles underlying distributed computing. The scope of the conference is pretty breadth, and it is described on its homepage: [https://www.podc.org/](https://www.podc.org/).

The symposium is taking place between 25-JULY-2022 and 29-JULY-2022 in Salerno, Italy. The [schedule](https://www.podc.org/podc2022/schedule/) includes  *Keynote Speakers, Sessions, Workshops, and Tutorials*.

The list of workshops and tutorials is the following:
* [Workshop on Advanced Tools, Programming Languages, and Platforms for Implementing and Evaluating Algorithms for Distributed Systems (ApPLIED)](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~elad/ApPLIED2022/)
* [Principles of Distributed Learning (PODL)](https://dcl.epfl.ch/site/podc2022)
* [Distributed Algorithms on Realistic Network Models (DARe)](https://podc-dare.github.io/)
* [Dispersion of Mobile Robots](https://sites.google.com/view/dispersion-mobilerobots-podc22/)

It's a great pleasure for me to obtain the opportunity to present our work [MARINA: Faster Non-Convex Distributed Learning with Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07845) at the [Principles of Distributed Learning (PODL)](https://dcl.epfl.ch/site/podc2022) workshop of that Symposium. [MARINA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07845) employs a novel communication compression strategy based on the compression of gradient differences which is reminiscent but different from the technique used in the [DIANA method of Mishchenko et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09269). Our methods are superior to previous state-of-the-art methods regarding the oracle/communication complexity. 
Unfortunately, my visit is under question due to considerable time delays with obtaining a VISA to Italy due to the series of National Holidays in Saudi Arabia and long-time official delays in obtaining VISAs through dedicated organizations (3 working weeks after application excluding national holidays).
