Research Scientist Intern (AI) offer, Facebook Inc., USA, Menlo Park

---

In 2021, I was excited to obtain Research Scientist Intern (AI) offer, from Facebook Inc., USA, Menlo Park. After passing competitive interviews I have read several papers that [Dr. Hao-Jun Michael Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U1efqpIAAAAJ) has recommended. 

We had several discussions and we have selected the research topic that is important to the company and at the same time for my Ph.D. 

Unfortunately, the internship has not happened due to the absence of a J1 VISA in the USA.
