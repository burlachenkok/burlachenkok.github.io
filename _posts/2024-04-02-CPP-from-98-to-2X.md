I am glad to share update about a technical note with some details regarding the C and all primary C++ programming language standards.

As of *April 02, 2024*, this technical note in PDF format consists of 118 pages. 

* GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020)
* Link to Markdown: [Cpp-Technical-Note.md](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md)

The C++ programming language is complex, but currently, it's the fastest high-level general purpose programming language in the world.

The information from this technical note can be helpful mainly for three categories of people:

* People who want to refresh or go deep into several language constructions in C++.
* Obtain a pretty in-depth overview of new features from C++11/14/17/20/23.
* People who need to support (legacy) C++03 or C99 code base.

Recently authors have decided to add (some) information regarding C++2023.
