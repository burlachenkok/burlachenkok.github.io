**"FL_PyTorch: Optimization Research Simulator for Federated Learning"** is publicly available on GitHub.

---

FL_PyTorch is a suite of open-source software written in python that builds on top of one of the most popular research Deep Learning (DL) frameworks PyTorch. We built FL_PyTorch as a research simulator for FL to enable fast development, prototyping, and experimenting with new and existing FL optimization algorithms. Our system supports abstractions that provide researchers with sufficient flexibility to experiment with existing and novel approaches to advance the state-of-the-art.

We are glad to announce that project is available to everybody. Reference to Code Repository: [https://github.com/burlachenkok/flpytorch](https://github.com/burlachenkok/flpytorch).

The paper **«FL_PyTorch: Optimization Research Simulator for Federated Learning»** is in proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on [Distributed Machine Learning DistributedML 2021](https://distributedml.org/).
The paper, presentation, and appendix are available in DistributedML'21 Proceedings: [https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3488659.3493775](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3488659.3493775).
Today the arXiv version of the paper contains a slightly more actual text about that tool:
: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03099](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03099).

In terms of the first steps to becoming familiar with that tool, I recommend the following sequence of steps:

1. Look 8-minute presentation here [https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3488659.3493775]
2. Read [https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03099](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03099)
3. Read [https://github.com/burlachenkok/flpytorch/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/burlachenkok/flpytorch/blob/main/README.md) and perform all needed preliminary steps.
4. Open GUI and look around for a first impression.
5. Look into FL_PyTorch at Rising Stars in AI Symposium 2022. The 25 minutes video of my talk: [https://webcast.kaust.edu.sa/mediasite/Showcase/kaust/Presentation/600c852bedf94c8298f92d8c1703f8521d](https://webcast.kaust.edu.sa/mediasite/Showcase/kaust/Presentation/600c852bedf94c8298f92d8c1703f8521d)
6. Read [https://github.com/burlachenkok/flpytorch/blob/main/TUTORIAL.md](https://github.com/burlachenkok/flpytorch/blob/main/TUTORIAL.md)
