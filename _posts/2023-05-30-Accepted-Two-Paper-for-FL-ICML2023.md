Two papers [FL with Regularized Client Participation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03662) and [Algorithms with Random Reshuffling and Gradient Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07021) have been accepted to FL-ICML-2023.

I was glad to work with my peers on two papers accepted to Workshop Federated Learning and Analytics in Practice: Algorithms, Systems, Applications, and Opportunities
for Fortieth International Conference on Machine Learning ICML 2023:

* [Federated Learning with Regularized Client Participation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03662)
* [Federated Optimization Algorithms with Random Reshuffling and Gradient Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07021)

I was glad to work with my peers:
* [Grigory Malinovsky]
* [Samuel Horváth], 
* [Abdurakhmon Sadiev]
* [Eduard Gorbunov]
* [Igor Sokolov]
* [Ahmed Khaled]

and of course with Prof. [Peter Richtárik].
