"FL_PyTorch: Optimization Research Simulator for Federated Learning" is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/burlachenkok/flpytorch).

---

FL_PyTorch is a suite of open-source software written in python that builds on top of one of the most popular research Deep Learning (DL) frameworks PyTorch. We built FL_PyTorch as a research simulator for FL to enable fast development, prototyping, and experimenting with new and existing FL optimization algorithms. Our system supports abstractions that provide researchers with sufficient flexibility to experiment with existing and novel approaches to advance the state-of-the-art.

The project is distributed in open source form under Apache License Version 2.0. Code Repository: [https://github.com/burlachenkok/flpytorch](https://github.com/burlachenkok/flpytorch).

----

The work is in proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on [Distributed Machine Learning DistributedML 2021](https://distributedml.org/). The paper, presentation, and appendix are available in DistributedML'21 Proceedings ([https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3488659.3493775](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3488659.3493775)).

The arXiv version of the paper ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03099](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03099)) contains a slightly more actual text in comparison to the original publication.

To become familiar with that tool, I recommend the following sequence of steps:

0. Join our Slack channel https://fl-pytorch-workspace.slack.com/

1. Look 8-minute presentation from [DistributedML 2021](https://distributedml.org/) workshop available here: [https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3488659.3493775](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3488659.3493775).

2. Read the recent version of the paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03099](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03099).

3. Read [https://github.com/burlachenkok/flpytorch/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/burlachenkok/flpytorch/blob/main/README.md) and perform all needed preliminary steps.

4. Launch GUI and look around for a first impression.

5. Look into FL_PyTorch at Rising Stars in AI Symposium 2022. 
The 25 minutes video talk: [https://webcast.kaust.edu.sa/mediasite/Showcase/kaust/Presentation/600c852bedf94c8298f92d8c1703f8521d](https://webcast.kaust.edu.sa/mediasite/Showcase/kaust/Presentation/600c852bedf94c8298f92d8c1703f8521d)

6. Read [https://github.com/burlachenkok/flpytorch/blob/main/TUTORIAL.md](https://github.com/burlachenkok/flpytorch/blob/main/TUTORIAL.md), and during reading, start to play with the tool on Logistic Regression or synthetized quadratics.
