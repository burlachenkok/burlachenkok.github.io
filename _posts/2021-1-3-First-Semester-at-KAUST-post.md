title: First Semester at KAUST as CEMSE/CS PhD student

# General 

As a former remote Stanford Student I can compare classes at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/) and at Stanford. 
In terms of time consumption for me as a Student it's the same and if material is new for me it will take 20 hours/week to deeply learn the subject through papers and books.

Benefit of the KAUST is that at Stanford some classes are so huge (500 and more students in one course) that there is no way to have dialog with professor. Professors at Stanford try to mitigate this.

At KAUST classes are smaller (20-30 students) and professors are also world level scientists.

KAUST culture give opportunity to have direct dialogue with professors on the subject to obtain deep insights! Or even inspiration for paper!

# Classes that I took:

As a part of my academic load I took several interesting classes at KAUST during my first semester which I can used for PhD qualification requirements in the first semester.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent Methods, CS 331 with prof.Peter Richtarik

"Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in one or another of its many variants is the workhorse method for training modern supervised machine learning models. 
However, the world of SGD methods is vast and expanding, which makes it hard for practitioners and even experts to understand its landscape and inhabitants. 
This course is a mathematically rigorous and comprehensive introduction to the field, and is based on the latest results and insights."

This is the first course in the world of such kind. Reasons:
*It covers recent materials from 2010-2020.
*Material covered in the cover SGD algorithms and Tools to analyze it, construct own algorithms suitable for specific situation or specific hardware
*Original methods has been developed not in a very uniform way of development.

The are a lot of materials. And in my personal feeling this course should have 6 credits.

## GPU and GPGPU Programming, CS380

This is ant interesting intensive coourse which covers both compute and graphical pipiles of modern GPUs.

What is an extra benefit the level of the details has different scales - from low-level hardware aspects of GPU to high level programming concepts.
Course is very useful. My final project for the course: [Final project report](https://bitbucket.org/konstantin_burlachenko/opt_studio/src/master/docs/CS380ProjectFinalReport.pdf)

## Stochastic Processes, STAT250

Contents of this course are relevant to several disciplines including statistics, communications and information systems, computer
engineering, signal processing, machine learning, bioinformatics, econometrics, and mathematical finance.

Contents: Probability theory, Introduction to Random Processes and main concepts.
Covering different forms of stochastic processes and usefull properties and tool work wtih them: 

Poisson processes, Gaussian processes, Branching processes, Linear filters, ARMA models, Markov disrete and continious time chains, elements of queuing theory.
                  
## CS 398 Graduate Seminar

Graduate Seminars is non-credit weekly seminar in various fields which has connection to CEMSE division where speakers are professors from KAUST or another universities, 
which share their research or observations. 

In one of the seminar was interesting recomentation from prof. Peter Wonka http://peterwonka.net/ about graduate (MS/PhD) studies and what does it mean:
