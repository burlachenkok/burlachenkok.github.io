title: First Semester at KAUST as CEMSE/CS Ph.D.
published: true
---

My first Semester at KAUST as CEMSE/CS Ph.D. student (Fall, 2020).

At KAUST classes are smaller (20-30 students) and professors are world level scientists.

KAUST culture gives the opportunity to have direct dialogue with professors on the subject to obtain deep insights! Or even inspiration for paper!

# Classes that I took:

As a part of my academic load, I took several interesting classes at KAUST during my first semester which I can use for Ph.D. qualification requirements in the first semester.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent Methods, CS 331 
"Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in one or another of its many variants is the workhorse method for training modern supervised machine learning models. 
However, the world of SGD methods is vast and expanding, which makes it hard for practitioners and even experts to understand its landscape and inhabitants. 
This course is a mathematically rigorous and comprehensive introduction to the field, and is based on the latest results and insights."

This is the first course in the world of such kind. Reasons:
*It covers recent materials from 2010-2020.
*Material covered in the cover SGD algorithms and Tools to analyze it, construct own algorithms suitable for a specific situation or specific hardware
*Original methods have been developed not in a very uniform way of development.

There are a lot of materials. And in my personal feeling, this course should have 6 credits.

The course was taught by [prof.Peter Richtarik](https://richtarik.org/) and has a lot of interaction with the students. 
If you're a student, you love math, and you're working under create future Machine Learning/AI you should enroll into it definitely!

## GPU and GPGPU Programming, CS380

This is an interesting intensive course which covers both compute and graphical pipelines of modern GPUs teched by [prof. Markus Hadwiger](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/markus-hadwiger).
Course webpage: [https://faculty.kaust.edu.sa/sites/markushadwiger/pages/cs380.aspx](https://faculty.kaust.edu.sa/sites/markushadwiger/pages/cs380.aspx)

What is an extra benefit the level of the details has different scales - from low-level hardware aspects of GPU to high-level programming concepts.
The course is very useful for people who want to work with GPU and obtain maximum benefit from it for computation or graphical projects. 

My final project for the course: [Final project report](https://bitbucket.org/konstantin_burlachenko/opt_studio/src/master/docs/CS380ProjectFinalReport.pdf)

## Stochastic Processes, STAT250

Contents of this course are relevant to several disciplines including statistics, communications and information systems, computer
engineering, signal processing, machine learning, bioinformatics, econometrics, and mathematical finance.

Contents: Probability theory, Introduction to Random Processes, and main concepts.
Covering different forms of stochastic processes and useful properties and tool work with them: 

Poisson processes, Gaussian processes, Branching processes, Linear filters, ARMA models, Markov discrete and continuous time chains, elements of queuing theory.

The course has time-limited exams. The course is very interesting and prof. David Bollin is a very interactive professor and a nice professor.
If you're familiar with Probability Theory, Functional Analysis it will help in the first part of the course. But not relax too much!

                
## CS 398 Graduate Seminar

Graduate Seminars is a non-credit weekly seminar in various fields which has a connection to the CEMSE division where speakers are professors from KAUST or another university, 
which share their research or observations. 

In one of the seminars, it was an interesting recommendation from [prof. Peter Wonka](http://peterwonka.net/) about graduate (MS/Ph.D.) studies and what does it mean:
