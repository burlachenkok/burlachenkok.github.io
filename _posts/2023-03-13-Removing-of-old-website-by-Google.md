title: Removing my old website by Google

My old website with 151 notes was deleted on 10 Mar. 2023, 08:58 by a "Google" user.

Between 2011 and 2020 I used another home page - [https://sites.google.com/site/burlachenkok/](https://sites.google.com/site/burlachenkok/). Unfortunately, my old website was deleted on 10 Mar. 2023, 08:58 by a "Google" user. And I have no means to recover it.

During my career path I as a fox peek my nose into different fields relative to Computer Science (CS). My old webpage contained 151 personal notes and did not contain any advertisements. 

During 2015 and up to 2023 my old homepage has been visited by **34'755** users. Total users have made **87'329** views of this content. The users of my old website were from **144** countries around the globe. Therefore, the content was not only useful for me, but also for another **34'755** users.

Top - 20 countries from which visitors to the old home page were:

# Future of Old Notes

I have some backups for the notes. And I would be glad to structure my notes well, but it's a time demanding procedure. For this, I need a lot of free time, which I don't have. Google has created a means to transition from the old website to the new one, but in my case, it did not work flawlessly.
